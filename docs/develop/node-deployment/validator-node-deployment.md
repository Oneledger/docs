At least **0.5 Million OLT** required for validator set up

## Pre-requisites

- Should be completed the fullnode deployment [setup](/docs/develop/node-deployment/full-node-deployment)

### Instructions

- Create an account in the secure wallet

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c "olclient account add --name your_preferred_name_for_memorisation"`
  
  (Note: It will prompt for password please enter)

- Run this command to get your node secure wallet stake address

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c "olclient list"`

- Send at least **0.5 Million OLT** to this account

- - You can use Chrome [OneWallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onewallet-kratos-mainnet/bbmdccojdbpcpmoadenplnoncfcijgkn?hl=en) extension to do this if the account you are sending from is in OneWallet;

- - You can use Chrome [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension to do this if the account you are sending from is in MetaMask;

- Apply staking command to become a validator

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c "olclient delegation stake --amount 500000 --address REPLACE_YOUR_STAKEADDRESS_HERE_WITHOUT_0lt_PREFIX"`

- **Congratulations!** Now you became a validator, you could check the status by this command

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c "olclient delegation status --address REPLACE_YOUR_STAKEADDRESS_HERE_WITHOUT_0lt_PREFIX"`

### Rewards management

- To Check reward information for a specific validator

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c 'olclient call query.GetTotalRewardsForValidator {\"validator\":\"REPLACE_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE_WITHOUT_0lt_PREFIX\"}'`

  it will print the info about pending, mature and withdrawn amount
  ```
  {
    "address": "0lt0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "matureBalance": "0",
    "pendingAmount": "2007145201754290708513",
    "totalAmount": "2007145201754290708513",
    "withdrawnAmount": "0"
  }
  ```

- Once you see no-zero "matureBalance" in above reward information, you are able to withdraw rewards

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c 'olclient rewards withdraw --amount XXX --address REPLACE_YOUR_STAKEADDRESS_HERE_WITHOUT_0lt_PREFIX'`

- After you withdraw rewards check the increased balance in validator stake address

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c 'olclient balance --address REPLACE_YOUR_STAKEADDRESS_HERE_WITHOUT_0lt_PREFIX'`

### Unstaking and validator purge

- To unstake your OLT (Note: If you unstake and validator is less than **0.5 Million** you will no longer be a validator)

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c "olclient delegation unstake --amount XXX --address REPLACE_YOUR_STAKEADDRESS_HERE_WITHOUT_0lt_PREFIX"`

- After unstake check your status

  `docker-compose exec olfullnode sh -c "olclient delegation status --address REPLACE_YOUR_STAKEADDRESS_HERE_WITHOUT_0lt_PREFIX"`

  When we unstake, there is a period of time referred to as “maturity time”. One can only withdraw the unstaked amount after this maturity time, since the unstake transaction. This maturity time is 80000 blocks, roughly ~two weeks.
